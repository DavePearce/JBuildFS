# JBuildFS

A framework for uniformly managing structured content stored in map-like structures.  For example, content stored on disk or in an archive file.  Here, a content _source_ provides a way to read content, whilst a _sink_ provides a way of writing content.  Content can be stored in journal-like structures called _ledgers_.
